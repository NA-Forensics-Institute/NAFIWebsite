                <p>
                    Lincoln Douglas debate is a one-on-one debate that is focused on philosophy and logic.
                    The debate topics change every two months and are based on what is morally right or wrong.
                    Lincoln Douglas improves one's skills in speaking, argumentation, and research.
                    Lincoln-Douglas debaters, with their experience in rebuttal delivery and speech writing,
                    soon become well versed in philosophy and become more fluent and confident speakers.

                <p>
                    Public Forum involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event.
                    Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker
                    position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option.
                    Students present cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a "crossfire"
                    (similar to a cross examination) with the opportunity to question the opposing team. Often times
                    community members are recruited to judge this event.

Freshman year was my first year of debating, nonetheless I picked it up pretty quickly and have a solid understanding of debate. I've dabbled in both policy and circuit LD, and traditional LD debate has always been my favorite event. My favorite part about LD would be framework debate, it's always fun to read cool different philosophies. I'm excited to share my knowledge of phil with our new debaters!
