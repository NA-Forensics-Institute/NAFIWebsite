                <p>
                    Lincoln Douglas debate is a one-on-one debate that is focused on philosophy and logic.
                    The debate topics change every two months and are based on what is morally right or wrong.
                    Lincoln Douglas improves one's skills in speaking, argumentation, and research.
                    Lincoln-Douglas debaters, with their experience in rebuttal delivery and speech writing,
                    soon become well versed in philosophy and become more fluent and confident speakers.

                    Public Forum involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event.
                    Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker
                    position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option.
                    Students present cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a "crossfire"
                    (similar to a cross examination) with the opportunity to question the opposing team. Often times
                    community members are recruited to judge this event.

                        <p>My name is Milun Jain, and I will be in 11th grade next school year at North Allegheny. I have competed in public forum debate for the past 2 years, and I have learned many things and made a lot of new friends. I have prior camp experience as I attend the Institute for Speech and Debate which is one of the best camps in the country last Summer. I hope to teach younger students some of the valuable skills I learned there and throughout the season. Some notable accomplishments in my debate career include getting to octofinals in Harvard JV Public Forum in my freshman year and qualifying to both the Pennsylvania state tournament and NSDA national tournament as a sophomore. </p>
